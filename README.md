# üõçÔ∏è Shop Sphere

**Shop Sphere** is a full-fledged **microservices-based e-commerce platform** designed with scalability, modularity, and high performance in mind. The system is composed of independent services that communicate with each other using **RabbitMQ** for asynchronous messaging and **gRPC** for high-performance communication between customer and product services.

---

## üß© Microservices Architecture

Shop Sphere consists of the following services:

### 1. üë§ Customer Service
- Handles:
  - Customer authentication
  - User cart & wishlist
  - Order history
  - Unread notification storage (notifications have a **TTL of 1 day**, after which they are deleted)
- **gRPC Client** to Product Service for:
  - Getting recommended products based on wishlist
  - Recommendations based on previous orders

### 2. üì¶ Product Service
- Handles:
  - Seller authentication
  - Product creation, update, deletion, and retrieval
- **gRPC Server**:
  - Accepts wishlist and past orders from Customer Service
  - Returns personalized product recommendations
- Advanced search using **MongoDB Aggregation Pipeline**
- Image uploads to **AWS S3**

### 3. üõí Shopping Service
- Handles:
  - Add to cart / Remove from cart
  - Clear cart
  - Order single/multiple products
  - Cancel orders
  - Add to wishlist / Remove from wishlist
- Includes:
  - **BullMQ** for scheduled jobs (e.g., simulated delivery)
  - **WebSocket (Socket.io)** to notify delivery progress in real-time

### 4. üåê API Gateway
- Acts as a **reverse proxy**, routing requests to appropriate services
- Implements **rate limiting** to mitigate DDoS attacks

## üß™ Installation & Setup

### üì¶ Prerequisites

Ensure the following tools/services are installed and configured:

* [Redis Installation Guide](https://redis.io/downloads/)
* [RabbitMQ Installation Guide](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/install-windows)
* [AWS S3 Bucket Setup Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/GetStartedWithS3.html) (with appropriate credentials configured)


## üöÄ Running the Project

### 1. Install Dependencies for Each Microservicecd Customer && npm install

 * cd Customer && npm install
 * cd Product && npm install
 * cd Shopping && npm install
 * cd gateway && npm install

### 2. Set Up Environment Variables

* Create a .env file in each service directory (Customer, Product, Shopping, gateway). Add the necessary environment variables as described in the Setup section of this README.

### 3. Start Redis & RabbitMQ Servers‚ö†Ô∏è 

 * Use WSL (Ubuntu) or Docker, depending on your environment.  Ensure these services are running before proceeding.
 
### 4. Start Each Backend Service
 * # Run the following command in each service directory (Customer, Product, Shopping, gateway):
 * npm run start

### 5. Start the Frontend

* cd frontend
* npm install
* npm run dev

### 6. Start gRPC Server (Product Service)

* First, ensure the following script is present in the package.json file within the src/Product directory:

* "scripts": {
  // ... other scripts
  "start:grpc": "node src/grpcServer.js",
  // ...
}

* Then, run the server:cd src/Product

* npm run start:grpc

### 7. Start BullMQ Worker (Shopping Service)

* Similarly, confirm this script exists in the package.json file inside the src/Shopping directory:

* "scripts": {
  // ... other scripts
  "start:bullmq": "nodemon src/Queue/worker.js",
  // ...
}

* After verifying the script, start the worker:cd src/Shopping

* npm run start:bullmq


## üìå Project Highlights

* ‚úÖ Modular Microservice Architecture ‚Äì Each core feature is separated into independent, scalable services.

* üì° gRPC Communication ‚Äì Enables fast and type-safe inter-service messaging.

* üì® RabbitMQ Integration ‚Äì Powers decoupled, scalable communication across services.

* üì∑ AWS S3 Storage ‚Äì Used for secure and efficient image uploads.

* ‚ö° Real-time Updates ‚Äì Achieved using Socket.io for order status and notifications.

* üõ°Ô∏è API Gateway ‚Äì Centralized entry point with rate-limiting for security and traffic control.

* ‚è±Ô∏è Scheduled Jobs with BullMQ ‚Äì Used to mimic real-world behavior of delayed order arrivals (e.g., simulating order status progression like "Packed ‚Üí Shipped ‚Üí Delivered").

## üìö Future Enhancements

* üßÆ Admin dashboard for sellers & platform analytics

* üîç Smarter recommendation engine using ML algorithms
