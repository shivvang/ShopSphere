# 🛍️ Shop Sphere

**Shop Sphere** is a fully-featured **microservices-based e-commerce platform** designed for **scalability**, **modularity**, and **high performance**. Built with modern technologies and best practices, the platform consists of decoupled services that interact via **RabbitMQ** and **gRPC**, enabling seamless asynchronous and high-speed communication.

---

## 🧩 Microservices Architecture

Shop Sphere is composed of the following services:

### 1. 👤 Customer Service
Responsible for managing customer-related operations:

- 🔐 Authentication
- 🛒 Cart & Wishlist
- 🧾 Order History
- 🔔 Unread notifications (with a **TTL of 1 day**)

**gRPC Client** to Product Service:
- Fetching personalized product recommendations based on:
  - Wishlist
  - Previous orders

---

### 2. 📦 Product Service
Handles everything related to products and sellers:

- 🛠️ Seller authentication
- 📋 CRUD operations for products
- 🔍 Advanced search via **MongoDB Aggregation Pipeline**
- 🖼️ Image uploads to **AWS S3**

**gRPC Server**:
- Accepts wishlist/orders from Customer Service
- Returns personalized recommendations

---

### 3. 🛒 Shopping Service
Manages core shopping actions:

- 🛍️ Add/Remove products from cart
- 🔄 Order placement & cancellation
- 💖 Wishlist management
- 🚚 Simulated deliveries using **BullMQ**
- 📡 Real-time delivery tracking via **WebSocket (Socket.io)**

---

### 4. 🌐 API Gateway
Acts as the entry point for all client requests:

- 🔁 Reverse proxy to route requests to the appropriate services
- 🛡️ Implements **rate limiting** for protection against DDoS attacks

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

### 🔧 Backend
- **Node.js**, **Express.js**
- **MongoDB**, **Redis**
- **RabbitMQ**, **BullMQ**
- **gRPC**, **Socket.io**
- **AWS SDK** (S3)

### 🎨 Frontend
- **React**, **Tailwind CSS**
- **Redux**
- **Socket.io Client**

### 💡 Frontend Optimizations
- 🧼 DRY Principles
- ✂️ Code splitting
- 🖼️ Lazy loading images
- ⚡ Memoization
- 🔍 Debounced search
- 📄 Pagination

## 🧪 Installation & Setup

### 📦 Prerequisites

Make sure the following tools/services are installed:

- [✅ Redis](https://redis.io/downloads/)
- [✅ RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/install-windows)
- [✅ AWS S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/GetStartedWithS3.html) (with proper credentials)

---

## 🚀 Running the Project

### 1️⃣ Install Dependencies

```bash
cd Customer && npm install
cd Product && npm install
cd Shopping && npm install
cd gateway && npm install
```

### 2️⃣ Set Up Environment Variables

- Create `.env` files for each service (Customer, Product, Shopping, gateway) as described above.

### 3️⃣ Start Redis & RabbitMQ Servers ⚠️

- Use **WSL**, **Ubuntu**, or **Docker** depending on your environment to launch Redis and RabbitMQ.

### 4️⃣ Start Backend Services

```bash
npm run start
# Run this inside each service directory
```

### 5️⃣ Start the Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

### 6️⃣ Start gRPC Server (Product Service)

Make sure your `package.json` in `src/Product` has the following:

```json
"scripts": {
  "start:grpc": "node src/grpcServer.js"
}
```

Then run:

```bash
cd src/Product
npm run start:grpc
```

### 7️⃣ Start BullMQ Worker (Shopping Service)

Check the script in `src/Shopping/package.json`:

```json
"scripts": {
  "start:bullmq": "nodemon src/Queue/worker.js"
}
```

Then run:

```bash
cd src/Shopping
npm run start:bullmq
```
